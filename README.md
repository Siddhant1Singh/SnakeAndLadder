# Snakes-and-Ladders

Snakes and Ladders is a popular board game enjoyed by people of all ages. In this project, I had implemented a clone of this game in JavaFX using SceneBuilder and OOPS concepts.

The implementation involved several challenges, including designing the game board and creating the logic for the snakes and ladders' movement, which was handled by giving a structure to the code using OOPS concepts. It also involved designing the user interface, including the display of the dice roll and the player's turn. These were handled using multithreading in JavaFX, so that the game flow is smooth while also giving the possibility of having some kind of dice animations going in the background.
